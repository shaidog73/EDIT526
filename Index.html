 <h2 id="overview">Team overview and history</h2>

  <p>In 1996 Major League Soccer began in the United States.  The League was created as part of an agreement between Soccer's (aka Football or Futbol) world governing body FIFA, and the United States Soccer Federation to create a professional league if the United States was awarded the World Cup tournament in 1994. </p>

  <p>Domestically, the club has won four MLS Cups (league championships), four Supporters' Shields (league regular season), three U.S. Open Cups (domestic cups), and six Eastern Conference championships. In international competitions, the club has one CONCACAF Champions Cup title and one Copa Interamericana, the only United States team to win the latter. In terms of trophies won, it is the joint-most successful overall club in American soccer (tied with the LA Galaxy).</p>

  <p>The club was an inaugural franchise in Major League Soccer, playing in the league since its first season in 1996. The club played a majority of its matches at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium from 1996 until 2017 before moving to the soccer-specific stadium, Audi Field, in 2018, where it has played since. D.C. United was one of the premier franchises in Major League Soccer, and in American soccer in the late 1990s, where it won the bulk of its trophies.<sub> Source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.C._United</sub></p>

  <p>After an early period of dominance and glory in the late 90's and early 2000's the team has struggled to make the playoffs in recent years.  Under current coach Troy Lesense, the team finds itself in the middle of the Eastern conference table, seeking to make a run for the playoffs in the second half of the 2025 season.    </p>

 <ol>
 <li>Each game is 90 minutes in two 45 minute halves

United’s new soccer-specific stadium, offers a textbook example of this and other urban design challenges that more and more urban cores will come to experience this century. The venue’s 8.5-acre site is among the tightest in Major League Soccer. The larger Buzzard Point redevelopment it anchors, meanwhile, is one of the city’s most ambitious."</img>
